// The above example is just about the most bare and basic html page you can create.
// Look at the panel in the lower right corner of this jsFiddle page, and you'll see the output
// of our first getting-started html page. All the text you see in the html panel above is commonly
// referred to as "html" or "html markup".

// Each pair of "tags" (i.e. <body> and </body>) have a beginning (<body>) and an ending (</body>).
// This special pattern of "markup" code instructs the web browser how to display the page to the user is a structured
// and visual way.

// Tags explained:

// <html>...</html> is the main wrapper around all of the page markup

// <head>...<head>  content here is not visually displayed on when the page is rendered in the browser,
//                  but it contains important information about the page that the web browser
//                  will use to render the page. Learn more in Lesson #XX.

// <body>...</body> all the visible stuff that a user will see goes in the <body> section.

// <script> ... </ script> Javascript code goes here which can added additional functionality to the web page.
